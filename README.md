# Ice Cream Exercise

This is a solution to the Ice Cream Order Form mini project at the end of workbook 3. It contains two different JavaScript files in the js directory:

- `js/script.js` - This file fulfils all of the requirements laid out in the workbook, and contains comment explaining and clarifying some of the choices I made in my implementation

- `js/autoupdate.js` - This file is a variation of `script.js`, which fulfills the stretch goal of getting the prices to update immediately whenever any input changes. It has comments explaining the differences between this file and `scripts.js`. In order to see this file in action:
  1. go to the end of `index.html`
  2. comment out the script tag that loads `scripts.js`
  3. uncomment the script tag that loads `autoupdate.js`
